# CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

Curso de Introducción a la Inteligencia Artificial de la Universidad de Harvard.

This repository contains my progress through the HarvardX course [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/), including projects, code, notes, and summaries (in English and Spanish).

## Course Summary

This course provides a practical and theoretical introduction to the core concepts of modern artificial intelligence. Students explore foundational algorithms behind technologies like game engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on Python projects, the course covers topics such as graph search, optimization, classification, machine learning, and large language models. By the end, students gain experience using AI libraries and learn to design their own intelligent systems.

## Course Overview

The course explores the foundations of artificial intelligence, including:
- Search
- Knowledge
- Uncertainty
- Optimization
- Learning
- Neural Networks
- Language

Each week includes a lecture, a practical project, and study notes.

## Notes and Summaries

- Cornell-style notes for each week
- Bilingual summaries (English + Español)
- Code snippets included for better understanding
