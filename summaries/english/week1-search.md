# Week 1 – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Course Introduction
**Instructor:** Brian Yu

**Course:** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

*“AI is not magic; it is a combination of logical, statistical, and computational techniques that allow it to simulate human reasoning.”*

## What is AI?
AI refers to techniques that allow computers to act intelligently or rationally, such as:

Face recognition

Playing games better than humans

Understanding human language (e.g., voice assistants)

Topics covered in the course:

Search
Teaching an AI how to search for solutions to problems (e.g., routing, playing games like tic-tac-toe).

Knowledge
Representing and reasoning with information to make logical inferences.

Uncertainty
Dealing with uncertain events using probability.

Optimization
Finding better (or the best) solutions to problems with many possibilities.

Machine Learning
Programming computers to learn from data and experience (e.g., spam detection).

Neural Networks
Inspired by the human brain, these allow programs to solve complex tasks effectively.

Natural Language Processing
How computers understand and respond to human (natural) language.
